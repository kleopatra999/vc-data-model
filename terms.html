  This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
  Verifiable Claims space by using specific terms to discuss particular
  concepts. This terminology is included below and linked to throughout the
  document to aid the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable claim|verifiable claims|claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A statement made about a <a>subject</a>. A <strong>verifiable claim</strong> is
a claim that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be cryptographically
verified.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential curator</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal verifiable
claim wallet, that stores and protects access to a <a>holder's</a>
credentials and verifiable claims.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential services">credential service</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a <a>credential</a> storage vault or personal
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to a
<a>holder's</a> credentials.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="CTP">credential transport protocol</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of messages and protocols for issuing, storing, requesting, and
transmitting <a>credentials</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that demonstrates the information in a <a>credential</a> is well-formed.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that cryptographically demonstrates the authenticity of a <a>credential</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URI-based identifier, also known as a DID, that is associated with
an <a>entity</a>. These
identifiers are most often used in a <a>credential</a> and are associated
with <a>holders</a> such that the <a>credential</a> itself can be easily
ported from one <a>identity provider</a> to another without the need to
reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID is:
<code>did:b6922d8e-20df-4939-95cd-f79375979178</code>
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible via an identifier registry and contains information
related to a particular <a>decentralized identifier</a> such as the
associated <a>identity provider</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
concept, or device.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more claims made by the same <a>entity</a> about a
<a>subject</a>. A <dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn>
is a credential that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be
cryptographically verified.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of one or more <a>verifiable claims</a>.
A holder is typically also the primary <a>subject</a> of the
<a>verifiable claims</a> that they are holding.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The means for keeping track of <a>entities</a> across contexts. Digital
identities enable tracking and customization of entity interactions across
digital contexts, typically using identifiers and attributes. Unintended
distribution or use of identity information can compromise privacy. Collection
and use of such information should follow the principles of minimal disclosure.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entity documents">entity document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A Web-based document that contains statements about a
particular <a>entity</a>. Entity documents MUST be accessible in
JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] format and MAY be accessible in other RDF-compatible formats.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entity owner's">entity owner</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of a particular <a>entity document</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity provider's|IdP|IdP's">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A software service that manages one or more <a>identities</a> and their
associated <a>credentials</a> on behalf of an <a>entity</a>. It typically
handles requests to store <a>credentials</a> issued by an
<a>issuer</a> and to retrieve <a>credentials</a> when requested by a
<a>inspector-verifier</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="profiles">profile</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>credentials</a> typically related to the same
<a>subject</a>. An <a>entity</a> may have multiple profiles and each profile
may contain <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. A
<dfn data-lt="verifiable profiles">verifiable profile</dfn> is
a profile that is tamper-resistant and whose contents are typically
counter-signed by the <a>holder</a> or <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identifier registries">identifier registry</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Registries typically mediate the creation and verification of <a>subject</a>
identifiers. Some registries, such as ones for UUIDs and public keys, act
merely as namespaces for identifiers.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>verifiable claim</a>, associates it
with a particular <a>subject</a>, and transmits it to a <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects|subject's">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> which may have multiple <a>verifiable profiles</a> and
about which <a>claims</a> may be made.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a> and
<a>inspector-verifiers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="inspector-verifier|inspector-verifiers|inspector-verifier's|credential inspector-verifiers|credential inspector-verifier's">inspector-verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that receives one or more <a>profiles</a> for
processing.
  </dd>
</dl>
